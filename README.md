# Pubilc Built Environment Microbiome Data
A summary of data resources available to [PreMiEr](https://premier-microbiome.org/) researchers.

This repository exists to host a webpage view of selected data resources and analyses.

To view the webpage, go to: [https://ivoryc.github.io/Pubilc_Built_Environment_Microbiome_Data/](https://ivoryc.github.io/Pubilc_Built_Environment_Microbiome_Data/)

The website itself is public, as are the data sets. However several resources such as processed data or additional data acquired through author communication, is not publicly available.  This additional data is usually available on request for researchers with [PreMiEr](https://premier-microbiome.org/).

### Formatting

For making pages using Rmardown, see [the rmarkdown cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook).\

Try to stick to simple features.  A few features that are already in use in the repository are:

 * [formated references](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook)
 * links to internal html pages, [like this](./index.html).
 * links to external urls, [like this](https://ivoryc.github.io/Pubilc_Built_Environment_Microbiome_Data/).
 * text formating such as [block quotes](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/tufte-quotes.html), _italics_, and **bold face**.


### Attribution and Citation

Always give credit.  

For any work, analysis, or data that you did no generate yourself, give a reference using the rmarkdown reference format: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook

When giving yourself / your group credit be sure to include the appropriate name(s).

### Data Security

This site talks _about_ resources, it may not be the best way to host and share the resources themselves.

**Do not** put data in git unless you mean for it to be pubic forever.  

**Do not** make unpublished data publicly available.  

If you have made essential modifications to data, check with your PI before makeing the modified form public.
