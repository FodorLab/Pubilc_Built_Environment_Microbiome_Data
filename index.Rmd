This data comes from the Hospital Microbiome Project.  There are several publications, reports and presentations describing the sampling effort that took place at the new hospital in Chicago before and after it opened in 2013.

The sequence data was published in @lax_et_al2017. 

[“Bacterial Colonization and Succession in a Newly Opened Hospital.”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5706123/)

Abiotic environment measurements were published in @ramos_spatial_2015.

[“Spatial and Temporal Variations in Indoor Environmental Conditions, Human Occupancy, and Operational Characteristics in a New Hospital Building.”](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118207)

These data can be linked using a mapping obtained from the authors.  PreMiEr researchers can contact the Fodor lab to access this.

Where to get counts files...

How were they generated...

This includes 3k samples out of 6k.

Additional metadata was obtained via correspondence with the authors. This allowed us to determine the "day of stay" feature for several samples.  PreMiEr researchers can contact the Fodor lab to get this mapping file.

## Analyses

Reproduce figure 1A.

See the [code walk through]() to reproduce figure 1A of @lax_et_al2017 using the counts table we generated with DADA2.
